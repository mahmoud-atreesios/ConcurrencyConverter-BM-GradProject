# ConCurrency Application

## About Concurrency Application

The Concurrency Application is developed by the DollaPal team in collaboration with BankMisr, an Egyptian bank. In today's fast-moving currency world, people require real-time currency conversion services, and investors need a centralized platform to compare between various currencies and access real-time values.

### Features

### Localization and Accessibility

We've taken localization and accessibility seriously. The Concurrency Application is available in both English and Arabic versions, making it convenient for users in Egypt and beyond. You can seamlessly switch between languages to enhance your experience. Moreover, we've supported localized languages in both left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) orientations, ensuring a cohesive user experience for all.

### Project Architecture

The Concurrency Application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, which provides clear separation between business logic and the view controller. This architecture enhances code organization, maintainability, and testability. In MVVM, the Model represents the data and business logic, the View displays the UI, and the ViewModel acts as a bridge between the Model and the View, handling data binding and user interactions.

### Packages Used

The Concurrency Application utilizes several open-source packages to enhance functionality and streamline development:

- [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift): Reactive programming library for asynchronous and event-driven programming.
- [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage): Efficient image loading and caching library.
- [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire): Elegant networking library for Swift.
- [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa): Mobile database that simplifies data storage and management, ideal for saving favorite currencies and live exchange rates.
